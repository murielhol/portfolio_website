          In 2022 I cycled the Tour Aotearoa in the official event. I absolutely
          loved doing this tour! Besides being a cool challenge, its a great way
          to see the country and meet people. In this blog I want to share some
          info, highlights, my bike setup and some tips, hope you enjoy the
          read!

        <p>
          Tour Aotearoa is a 3000km tour through New Zealand, from the top of
          the North Island to the bottom of the South Island. The
          <a href="http://www.touraotearoa.nz/p/home.html">
            official website
          </a>
          has lots of information about the route and how to participate. The
          organisation is mint! You can download the gpx files on the event
          page, and you can also buy up-to-date booklets that have all the info
          and tips you can need. There also is a great community around the
          route on
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/touraotearoa">facebook</a>.
          You can do the route anytime, but every 2 years there is an official
          event. You apply for this on
          <a href="https://app.maprogress.com/">Maprogress</a>, where you rent
          or register a GPS tracker. Maprogress provides a very cool real time
          tracking dashboard, which is awesome, as your friends and family can
          track your progress through the event!

          If you are used to bike-touring in Europe (like me), it is good to
          know there are some key differences. Although most of it is on sealed
          roads, a significant portion of the route is on tricky single-track
          that is only really suitable for skilled mountain-bikers. There is
          also quite a large portion of gravel, and not always the nice kind of
          gravel. Being a noob on anything that is not a sealed road, this meant
          quite a lot of hike-a-bike for me. But it were those tricky trails
          that lead to the most beautiful remote places, so it was 100% worth
          it! And I did like the challenge, most of the time ;) Then finally you
          need to be prepared to climb lots, if you are from the Netherlands
          like I am, that means you will be wise to train this beforehand. This
          reminds me of a quote that one of the riders posted on facebook:

        <p><strong>The boat from Pouto Point to Parakai</strong></p>
        <p>
          I loved the little boat and how the bikes had to be lifted onto it.
          Also cool that all cyclists gather on the beach to wait for the boat,
          its a good moment to meet each other.

        <p><strong>Whanganui National Park and River</strong></p>
        <p>
          I was super excited and nervous for the Kaiwhakauka track, known to be
          tricky. So when after this seriously challenging stage I found myself
          surrounded by lush wild national park beauty, I felt pretty ecstatic.
          Not to mention all the cute wild goats roaming around. After
          completing the Mangapurua track you arrive at the Bridge to Nowhere,
          where you take the jet boat to Pipiriki. This jetboat ride across the
          Whanganui River was absolutely breathtaking. A day to never forget.

            >Steamship from Queenstown to Walter Peak and the trail to Mavora
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          At Queenstown, you have to cross Lake Wakatipu to Walter Peak Station.
          You can take a water taxi, but the historic steamboat TSS Earnslaw
          will also take your bike. I took the steamboat and loved it, cool to
          see the ovens as well! I highly recommend camping at the freedom
          camping at Walter Peak, absolutely stunning and so peaceful. The bike
          ride from Walter Peak to Mavora was an absolute highlight. You bike
          through remote and stunning farmland, between the loosely roaming
          animals. The latter meant I had to overcome my fear for a couple of
          huge bulls that stayed put on the side of the road. The mountains, the
          land, the fastness, its just a magical place.

          <strong>The people and animals</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            people participating in the tour were all absolutely epic.</strong
          >
          Although I mainly cycled alone, I often saw 'the gang' during the
          coffee breaks. I definitely felt safe doing the event alone, but it
          really helped knowing I could rely on my fellow participants, and I
          have been asked many times how I was doing, and if I wanted to join
          people if it was getting dark.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>I was also overwhelmed by the hospitality.</strong> Everyone
          was very helpful and I loved it when someone waved on the street or
          from their car, which gave me a real boost. Although I camped most of
          it, some days I would stay in a guest room via airbnb. I stayed for
          dinner a couple of times, and met some lovely people this way.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing I like about bike-packing is that you become very
          vulnerable. I feel this makes me connect with people and the
          surrounding in a very different way. I find this a great experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Not to forget the animals!</strong> I often found myself
          cycling through or next to a bunch of cows on their way to the milking
          shed. There were also some paths that went through an area where the
          animals walked free, resulting in some funny encounters. Lots of wild
          goats, lots and lots of birds and ofcourse the bugs hiding in my tent.
          Less lovely were the infamous sand flies on the west coast, never
          again will I forget to bring anti-bug lotion. Being with lots of
          animals is definitely something I love about bike-packing and New
          Zealand is great for it.

        <p>
          I was lucky to buy a bike second-hand from a girl that works at a bike
          shop, she created the perfect bike-packing setup. Its is a
          <li>Specialized Diverge Base Carbon</li>
          <li>with Ritchey Comp Beacon Flare bars</li>
          <li>DT Swiss G540 wheels with Tracer Pro 47 tires</li>
          <li>SRAM Force Rear Derailleur</li>
          <li>SRAM SX crankset with a 32t chainring</li>
          I had 0 mechanicals, not even a flat tire. Given I had many crashes, I
          was super impressed by this. Its a very light bike, which was very
          convenient during all the hike-a-bike parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a mountain bike lover, and technically skilled, then I
          definitely don't recommend this bike. Its very fast on sealed roads
          and the nice kind of gravel, but its a pain on technical trails.
          However, even if you had given me a mountain bike with fat tires and
          suspension, I would not have had the skills to handle it so
          hike-a-bike was a good deal for me, I made up for the lost time on the
          nice parts. Bike-packing events such as this one, that mixes endless
          sealed roads with crazy mountain bike paths will always mean its a
          trade-off when it comes to choosing a bike. Just pick something that
          fits you. For example, I met a girl who did the same event who loved
          mountain biking. She had a steel surly with fat tires and suspension
          and she finished 2 days earlier than me. She definitely was stronger
          in general, but especially at least twice as fast on the mountain bike
          paths.

        <strong>Gear I really recommend</strong>

        <p>
          <strong
            >Pedals that are flat on 1 side and clip in on the other.</strong
          >
          I had the
          <a
            href="https://bike.shimano.com/en-EU/product/component/shimano/PD-EH500.html"
            >Shimano PD-EH500</a
          >. Some tracks are muddy and make your cleats clog up. I also felt a
          lot more save on some tracks when not clipped in.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Louise Dropper Post Harness </strong> from
          <a href="https://waywardriders.com/">waywardriders</a>. I have a small
          bike (size 49) and it still worked for me. I had my 1.5 kg tent in it
          and a puffer jacket. Just a very easy, light and versatile piece of
          engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Ritchey Comp Beacon Flare bars. </strong> Sooo many hand
          positions, and so comfy. I had 0 issues with my hands or upper back.
          Definitely also get some aerobars though, they will be great for the
          strong head winds, or when you need to rest your arms. And to put
          stuff onto it!
        </p>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://shop.reservewheels.com/products/fillmore-tubeless-valves?variant=41504818561205"
            ><strong>Fillmore tubeless valves </strong></a
          >. From the small experience I have with both tubed and tubeless, I
          find tubeless faster and more comfy. Also had 0 punctures so far. And
          when you go tubeless, these valves are pretty amazing; they allow a
          lot more air to flow through the valve, and prevent the valve from
          clogging up with sealant. I could pump up my 47mm tires with just a
          little crappy hand-pump without much effort. And the valve cap system
          makes its easy to let some air out when going off-road.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Foam mattress. </strong>I heard several people with leaking
          air mattresses. Its also a great way to pack your stuff, I just rolled
          it all up inside of the mattress. I had the
          <a
            href="https://www.thermarest.com/ie/sleeping-pads/trek-and-travel/ridgerest-solite-sleeping-pad/ridgerest-solite.html"
            >RidgeRest SOLite sleeping pad</a
          >
          from Thermarest which is only 0.4kg for the regular size. I did find
          it having a warming effect, and it was thick enough for me to sleep
          comfy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Foam cover for the saddle. </strong> Although I used lots of
          chamois cream, my bum was not happy after 3 days in the saddle. Then I
          picked up a memory foam saddle cover in Auckland, and it was gone! In
          general chamois cream did not work for me. Bepanthen however, did
          magic.

        <p>
          <strong>Loose items tied to the bike. </strong>In my naiveness, I
          would do things like tieing my sweater with 2 knots to my saddle bag,
          or I attached my bike light to the front areaobar with a rubber band.
          But the roads on this event are not that forgiving, and anything that
          has the slightest chance of getting loose, will get loose. So I
          learned the hard way that unlike the bike-packing I was used to, you
          cant have a mug cutely dangling on the side of the saddlebag in this
          event: stuff needs to be very very very securely attached to the bike
          else its gone.

          <strong>Bike locks.</strong> I brought 3 bike locks with me, which
          really was not needed. I could have done with 1 light one. Not sure if
          this is true outside of New Zealand, but many times it was fine to
          leave it outside of the cafe or shop, or at most 1 lock would be
          sufficient.

          <strong>My tent.</strong> I camped 14 of the 21 nights. Firstly
          because I love camping, but also because especially on your own you
          save at least 50 dollars a night. You are also a lot more flexible
          when camping, as especially after Covid there are areas with no or
          only very expensive accommodations. I do recommend a room every 4 or 5
          nights to get everything washed and dried, and to charge your things
          overnight. Anyhow, next time I would replace my tent with a bivvy bag
          and a tarp. A bivvy is a lot warmer, and just less weight, and a tarp
          would give enough shelter and is quicker to pack up. Although only
          being 1.5 kg, and its a great tent, I still think my tent was a bit of
          an overkill and packing it up in the dark was a bit of a hassle.

        </h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Start cycling early.</strong> It gets blazing hot in NZ and it
          really helped me to get as many miles done as possible while it was
          cool. Besides that its kinda cool to see the sun come up while you
          ride.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Wear a compression legging </strong> when not cycling. I did
          not fully recover yet from a knee injury at the start of the event,
          and my physio advised me to wear a compression legging preferably also
          at night. It really helped me, and I noticed that when I did not wear
          them, I would have more sore legs the next day.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Don't plan too much.</strong> I planned too much for the first
          week, which meant some days where too long for me, and some days where
          too easy. Better to see how you go and make the most of the good days
          when you can, and give yourself a rest when needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Don't forget to train the arms and core.</strong> I stopped
          going to body-pump long before the event and I definitely regret it.
          Strong arms would have been really nice during the hike-a-bike and
          there were also these bridges where you had to walk over with your
          bike vertically. I really wished I had more upper body strength as
          that would have saved me lots of bloopers.

          I am incredibly grateful for having done this tour. I realize only
          view people have the freedom, the time, the health and the finance to
          undertake something like this. Its also incredible to see how much New
          Zealand is doing to keep nature flourishing, protected and clean. I
          was amazed by how well the trails, the freedom campings and even the
          public toilets were maintained. So thank you New Zealand
